# Mapping Accessibility of Public Services Near CUNY Campuses

This project explores the spatial relationship between City University of New York (CUNY) campuses and NYC Benefits Access Centers using open datasets and geospatial analysis.

The goal was to assess how geographically accessible public service centers are to students, supported by data visualization and a bonus machine learning model for borough classification.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Merged and cleaned two public datasets using geolocation
- Calculated distances between CUNY campuses and the nearest access centers
- Visualized findings with bar charts, histograms, and an interactive map
- Built a PyTorch model to classify boroughs based on spatial features
- Documented the full process in a formal technical report
