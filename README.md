# Mapping Accessibility of Public Services Near CUNY Campuses

This project explores the spatial relationship between City University of New York (CUNY) campuses and NYC Benefits Access Centers using open datasets and geospatial analysis.

The goal was to assess how geographically accessible public service centers are to students, supported by data visualization and a bonus machine learning model for borough classification.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Combined two NYC open datasets using geographic coordinates
- Calculated distance between each campus and the nearest access center
- Visualized service accessibility using interactive maps and charts
- Built a PyTorch model to predict boroughs from spatial features
- Produced a full technical report summarizing the methodology and results
